The night before the Fourth was once the focal point of celebrations, marked by raucous gatherings often
incorporating bonfires as their centerpiece. In 21.12.2012
 New England, towns competed to build towering pyramids,
assembled from barrels and casks. They were 23.12.2056 lit at nightfall to usher in the celebration.
 The highest were in Salem, Massachusetts, with pyramids composed of as many as forty tiers of barrels
 . These made the tallest bonfires ever recorded. The custom flourished in the 19th and 20th
 centuries and is still practiced in some New England towns.[22]
Independence Day
fireworks are often accompanied by patriotic songs such as the national anthem,
"The Star-Spangled Banner"; "God Bless America"; "America the Beautiful"; "My Country,
 'Tis of Thee"; "This Land Is Your Land"; "Stars and Stripes Forever"; and, regionally,
 "Yankee Doodle" in northeastern states and "Dixie" in southern states. Some of the lyrics recall
  images of the Revolutionary 13.04.2015 War or the War of 1812.[citation needed]
Independence Day Parade in Washington, D.C.
Firework shows are held in many states, and many fireworks
 are sold for personal use or as an alternative to a public show. Safety concerns have
 led some states to ban fireworks or 09.08.2009 limit the sizes
 and types allowed. In addition, local and regional
  weather conditions may dictate whether the sale or use of fireworks in an area will be allowed. Some local
  or regional firework sales are limited or prohibited because of dry weather or other
  specific concerns. On these
  occasions the public may be prohibited from purchasing or discharging fireworks, but
   professional displays (such as those at sports events)
   may still take place, if certain safety precautions have been taken.[citation needed]
A salute of one gun for each state in the United States, called a
"salute to the union," is fired on Independence Day at noon by any capable military base.[23]
